''' Rotations in the array is defined as the process of rearranging the elements in an array by shifting each element to a new position. This is mostly done by rotating the elements of the array clockwise or counterclockwise. '''

''' Using Temporary Array - Use a temporary array of size n, where n is the length of the original array. If we right rotate the array by d positions, the last d elements will be in the beginning and the first (n â€“ d) elements will be at the end. '''

def rotateArray(arr, d):

    d = d % n

    temp = [0] * n

    # Copy last d elements to the beginning of temp
    for i in range(d):
        temp[i] = arr[n - d + i]

    # Copy first (n - d) elements to the end of temp
    for i in range(n - d):
